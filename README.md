 M. Bye v18.0

# Installation
* Extract the zip folder
* Add the folder to your MATLAB path
    * From the menus select `File` -> `Set Path`
	* Navigate and select the newly extracted folder
	* Click `Add with Subfolders`
    * Click `Save`
	* Click `Close`
Type `EPRtoolbox` in the MatLab command window to start the main toolbox
Type `PowerSat` to start the power saturation tool
    (also available through the main toolbox)

# Full functionality
The toolbox contains many useful scripts that are not contained within the
main graphical user interface. Feel free to browse these at your leisure
(particularly the `misc` directory for zerofilling, noise filters, etc).

Each has an extensive help header section and will have a link to the online
help with examples of how to use the script.

# A note on user interfaces
In MatLab 2015a MathWorks (the company behind MatLab) dramatically changed the
backend to how MatLab makes and runs user interfaces. All development with the
EPRtoolbox was made in MatLab 2013a, and so the user interfaces *WILL NOT* work
with newer versions of MatLab.

This is a known problem for many developers, and I do not have the time (or the
MatLab licenses) to rebuild every user interface in the toolbox from scratch.

So I face the decision of,
1. remove all the user interfaces from the toolbox
2. leave the user interfaces in and confuse users with newer MatLab versions

As the toolbox is only in essential maintenance mode, I have elected to leave
the functionality in place so that old users and keep using the functions they
are already familiar with. Whilst I hope this notice, will alert new users of
the toolbox that not all functionality is available.

New developers can of course, branch this project and expand the functionality
to newer versions of MatLab.
