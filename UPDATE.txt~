M. Bye v13.05

v13.05

--- EPRtoolbox passes 150,000 lines of code ---

Numerous minor bug fixes and improvements.

EPRtoolbox
==========
> Menus updates
> Technical documentation of all scripts link added to help menu

MISHAP - ALPHA
==============
MISHAP has been in constant development and is near release

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% v13.04 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

--- EPRtoolbox hits 800 downloads ---

PowerSat
========
> When loading a file, check added to see if file has already been loaded.
    If so, erases previous file, preventing errors and allows for better
    file comparison.
> "File" > "Reset all" now clears the old data files and axes instead of
    opening a new instance of PowerSat and closing the old one
> Changed PS_Pi so that Pi is calculated faster and calculated
    automatically if nitrogen and DPPH have been loaded, allowing for
    single oxygen or NiEDDA experiments to be analysed and not requiring
    all 4 datasets to be loaded.
> Minor bug fixes, better graphic presentation.
> More error reporting added - if power saturation fails or Pi is not able
    to be calculated then the user is messaged.

e2a
===
> Added interpolation variable so that the created files can have data
    points at a given interval eg. 0.2 gives a data point every 0.2 G
> Changed input address - removes conflict with address command
> Added switch for output to the same folder - so that if the folder is the
    current folder it still works

e2af
====
> Added interpolation variable so that the created files can have data
    points at a given interval eg. 0.2 gives a data point every 0.2 G
> Added 'noheader' option for use with programs that do not like headers
> Compatible with pyDipfit:
    e2af('/folder/of/files','\t', '.dat', 'noheader', 0.2)

NEW FEATURE: eprViewer - BETA
=============================
This feature will eventually take over from cwViewer as the main viewer
interface with more features and significantly better handling of pulsed
experiments.

NEW FEATURE: MMM_figureshaper
=============================
Take DEER window distance distribution saved figures and plot them nicely,
saving them automatically as an image file whilst simultaniously generating
a .CSV file of the x and y axis.

FEATURE REMOVAL: MMM_rotamers (directory/_install.m/_uninstall.m)
===========================================
Feature not required with new MMM release.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% v13.03 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

--- EPRtoolbox hits 700 downloads ---

Various bug fixes to many scripts

MMM 2013
========
Work here has been published in the new version of MMM in that the PDB read
and write functions have been revamped to conform better with the PDB
standard and ensure better functionality with other programs.
Namely enforcing 80 character lines.

EasyRefiner
===========
> Added a "Run later" button, so that the start of a fitting run can be 	defined as an exact date and time in the future.
> Better error handling
> Supports long file names
> Closing waitbar cancels queue at end of current fit
> Seperation of EasySpin stats in command window using file name
> Add fit results to the output
> Handling of non-valid file name characters in file title


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% v13.02 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

EasyRefiner
===========
Faced with 50+ cw spectra to put through EasySpin to get accurate
g-tensors, A-values and correlation times, this GUI will simulate
folders of spectra at a time and through multiple steps refine each
value.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% v13.01 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

--- EPRtoolbox hits 600 downloads ---

Github
======
Constant development has been moved to github:
github.com/morganbye/EPRtoolbox
This allows users to pull updates as soon as they are coded. Releases will
still be made to sourceforge as appropiate, but the toolbox_working_
directory will be used less and less.

BrukerRead
==========
Big update to BrukerRead so that it now reliably can open and plot almost
all common pulsed EPR experiments including FID, FSE, PELDOR, ESEEM,
HYSCORE, ENDOR, DONUT.

cwViewer
========
Many improvements for Windows users, Windows despite what the documentation
says, uses a different addressing system for positioning windows/figures.
Switches have been introduced such that windows always appear on-screen and
not just above it as was reported by some users.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% v12.12 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

PowerSat
========
Big update for PowerSat fixing a lot of bugs. Especially concerning fitting
of curves and file handling when a folder of files was used rather than a 
single 3 dimensional .DTA/.DSC/.YGF file.

Minor updates to figure creation and presentation.

cwnorm
======
cwnorm now has the optional argument of 'true', this allows for a true
normalisation of data between 0 and 1 rather than scaling data between -1
and 1.

DeerExtract
===========
Now with automatic plotting of figures from DeerAnalysis

NEW FOLDER: HADDOCK
===================
New to the EPR toolbox is a set of tools for use with the NMR docking
program HADDOCK (haddock.science.uu.nl).

Currently these tools extend to post docking calculation manipulation and
presenting of data. Stay tuned for further features in later releases.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% v12.10 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

NEW FEATURE: e2af
=================
By request from the guys at NREL, e2a has been expanded to convert an
entire folder of Bruker files to ASCII files in one easy script.

MMM intergration
================
Integration between the EPR toolbox and tools provided by ETH Zurich
(namely MMM and DeerAnalysis) has begun. This is part of a longer term
project. This work is not yet published, but can start to be seen in
changes to pdbimport/pdbexport.

eloader
=======
Update reflecting changes in BrukerRead


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% v12.9  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Acknowledgements
================
A short acknowledgements section has been added to README.txt

Video Demonstrations
====================
PowerSat and cwViewer now have demonstration videos available on YouTube,
see each programs help section for links, or their webpage to view.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% v12.8  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

--- EPRtoolbox hits 500 downloads ---

PowerSat
========
Another big update for PowerSat. Raw data can now be fitted using 5
different methods
1) Manually defined single points
2) Splitting the peak into a positive and negative peak and then fitting
    each with a Gaussian distribution
3) Same as 2 but with a Lorentzian distribution
4) Fitting the signal with a 1st derivative Gaussian distribution, the 2nd
    derivative is then calculated, and where the 2nd derivative = 0 then
    that is the turning point (peak or trough) of the 1st derivative
5) Same as 4 but with a Lorentzian distribution

randaddnoise
============
addnoise - renamed to avoid conflict with addnoise from EasySpin, as most
users will have both installed. Minor update to help and argument inputs

General toolbox
===============
Several functions have had minor tidy ups and optimisations


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% v12.7  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

PowerSat
========
Massive rebuild of PowerSat, spectra can now be fitted with Gaussian peaks
before the peak-to-peak height is taken. Accessibility calculations, have
been improved and additional functionality for folder loading as well as 
full compatibility with Bruker .spc/.par files from EMX machines.

cwViewer
========
New function/window that allows you to send the currently viewable screen
to EasySpin. Suitable for quick or frequently repeated EasySpin functions.
The window comes complete preloaded for nitroxide spin labels

BrukerRead
==========
Big reworking so that it now works with .spc/.par files from Bruker EMX
spectrometers, having received some files to play with

DeerExtract
===========
Function has been reworked so that it finds an open DeerAnalysis window by
searching all MATLAB figure windows and then gets the figures. This means
that it automatically obtains data arrays with no export needed.

DeerConverter
=============
Error handling added so that no error is presented if a user cancels the
selection of a file


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% v12.5  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

NEW FEATURE: sgol
=================
Crude implementation of the Savitzky-Golay smoothing function. This allows
for data to be smoothed without such pronounced problems of line/peak 
broadening and intensity lose found with a moving point average.


NEW FEATURE: Documentation
==========================
The toolbox now comes with a folder "doc" inside of which is index.html
which gives support to all EPR Toolbox files in web page format.


cwViewer
========
> Savitzky-Golay smoothing function added to Viewing Options
> Add noise function added to Viewing Options
> x-axis can now be switched between Magnetic Field and g-value
> Export of CSV data includes g-values

BrukerRead
==========
> Better handling of pulse experiments
> Inputs changed so that 'plot' can be used by itself
> Figure plotting reconfigured and improved
      - imaginary channel for pulse experiments
      - legend is displayed for real/imaginary channels
      - x-axis corrected for time or mag field depending
         on FSE or FID experiment with correct units/label

BrukerWrite
===========
Changed 3rd input argument so that if a file path is
specified then the script writes out to that address. Only
useful really for when this script is called from other
scripts; ie. in a for loop for writing many files


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% v12.1  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

DEERextract
===========
> Extract the raw data behind plots in ETH Zurich's DeerAnalysis

pdbexport
=========
> Partner script to pdbimport
